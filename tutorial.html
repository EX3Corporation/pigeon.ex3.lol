        <h1><a href="/">pigeon</a>: tutorial</h1>
        <p>pigeon is very easy to set up and begin using. It only takes one command, and then you can chat with it, how
            cool, am I right?!</p>
        <p>Below is a basic quick start guide, what else you can do, and then some.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p><a href="/invite">First, invite pigeon to your server.</a> You will need the <strong>Manage Guild</strong>
            permission as a baseline, and the same permissions pigeon requires. If not, ask someone higher.</p>
        <p>Once you have invited pigeon, I recommend you create a new channel <i>just for it</i>. Since pigeon is
            designed to occupy and listen to an entire channel, unless you already have an unused throwaway channel,
            create one.</p>
        <p>Once you have created / selected a channel to use, you can initiate it using <strong>/chat</strong> and
            append the target channel. <strong>Only people with Manage Server can do this.</strong> After that, pigeon
            is immediately available to use, and you're all set!</p>

        <h2>Managing your chat</h2>
        <p>pigeon keeps up to 200 messages per chat, and the oldest ones disappear once you reach 200. You can quickly
            reset and export/import your chat at any time. Read on...</p>
        <h3>Resetting your chat</h3>
        <p>There are two ways to reset your chat:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run <strong>/clearhistory</strong> to immediately clear</li>
            <li>Run <strong>/history clear:true</strong> to export your chat and clear when done</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exporting your chat</h3>
        <p>You can easily export your chat using <strong>/history</strong>. As stated above, if you append
            <strong>clear:true</strong> to the execution, it clears your chat after exporting it. pigeon will then
            generate a JSON file containing the messages and basic info about you and the server you used it in. It then
            uploads it, where it is kept for 3 days before automatic deletion. pigeon will then return a link to this
            website where you can view your transcript and also allow you to download the JSON it created.
        </p>

        <h3>Importing your chat</h3>
        <p>From the transcript viewer, go down to the bottom and find "View raw data". Right-click or long-press it and
            press "Save link as". Go back to Discord, then run <strong>/import</strong> and attach the JSON file. You
            cannot import other peoples transcripts, unless you edit the JSON to match <i>you</i>, but that would be a
            very petty thing to do.</p>

        <h2>Managing pigeon</h2>
        <p><strong>Let's cut to the chase</strong>: pigeon can only be used in channels you designate it to, and
            anywhere in your server
            when manually called. It will not send random messages, randomly DM you, none of that. pigeon can easily be
            disconnected and paused. Read on...</p>
        <h3>Pausing pigeon from responding</h3>
        <p>Run <strong>/ignore</strong> with how long you want pigeon to pause. You can interrupt this by using
            <strong>/unignore</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Stop pigeon from responding</h3>
        <p>Run <strong>/remove</strong>. <strong>Only people with Manage Server can do this</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Change / check what channel pigeon listens to</h3>
        <p>Run <strong>/chat</strong> with nothing added to check what channel, and <strong>/chat</strong> with a
            channel selected to change.</p>

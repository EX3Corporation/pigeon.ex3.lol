        <h3>In a nutshell</h3>
        <p>
            pigeon is a minimalist AI chatbot for Discord. It is designed to listen to a singular channel and respond to
            all messages (excl bots)
            within it. These messages are stored in a chat history of up to 200 messages. pigeon can
            <strong>NOT</strong> process/see
            attachments, heavily search the web,
            or do any fancy stuff. <strong>It is intentionally lacking modern features.</strong> pigeon can also be
            called anywhere
            within a server @pigeon. <strong>These calls process external context (as in the past 10 messages),
                and these calls do not contribute to your chat history context.</strong> pigeon can be used as
            normal in direct messages, but not everything is supported. Your chat can be exported with
            <strong>/history</strong>,
            cleared using
            <strong>/clearhistory</strong>, and imported using
            <strong>/import</strong>. Import files can be generated using
            <strong>/history</strong>, clicking "View raw data" and saving the page, such as CTRL+S or <i
                class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> then <i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> on mobile.

            <strong>Q:</strong> What is this?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> pigeon is a simple AI Discord chatbot. You can talk to it in a server, or DMs. Just here
            for a chat, you heard?

            <strong>A:</strong> Email me! <a href="mailto:me@exerinity.com">me@exerinity.com</a><br>
            If that bug also threw some errors, give me the timestamp of when it happened! Thank you in advance, Batman.

            <img src="https://i.exerinity.com/9F3wCixz3X.png" width="300"><br>
            <strong>A:</strong> pigeon employs a small timer for all messages for a few reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>Debugging</li>
            <li>Used in tandem with the 2.5 second rate limit (read below)</li>
            <li>Aesthetical reasons. It's not in your way.</li>
        </ul>
        Nuff said. There is no way to turn it off.<br><br>

            <strong>Q:</strong> When was it made?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> September 2024. Idea coined July.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Why is the model so stupid?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Because I'm still tuning the system instructions and constantly comparing models. If you
            want top-tier professional always-correct answers, you're in the wrong place.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Why won't it respond?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Check that the bot has permission to send messages in the channel. If it does, check the
            set channel using <code>/chat</code>. If none is set, set one using the same command.<br><br>
            If it does not respond in direct messages, make sure you have DMs enabled from server members. If you do,
            check the
            mutual servers - one may have DMs temporarily paused. If it still doesn't work, email me.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Are there limits?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> In terms of per chat? Yes, 200 messages. I plan on raising this as development
            progresses, but it's not important. In terms of a rate limit? Not that I'm aware of. I didn't set any hard
            limits, but it may hit rate limits.<br><br>
            If you get over 200 messages, the oldest get overwritten, so it won't just suddenly "stop" when you reach
            it.<br><br>There is a 2.5 second message cooldown per person to prevent spam. This is a generous limit -
            Discord is very easy to spam quickly, but 2.5 seconds gives you time to respond.<br><br>Very long messages
            are paginated into several messages.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Do you store chats?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> No, unless you run /history, which it is stored for 3 days. I
            do not check them unless someone has notified me of misuse or bugs. "External server" is sugarcoating that
            its a Cloudflare R2 bucket.

        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> What model do you use?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Currently, Grok 4 Fast. pigeon started off on GPT-3.5, moved to Gemma (Gemini's little
            brother), then LLaMA 4 Scout. It then used Gemini 2.5 Flash from July 2025 until February 2026, but it might return.

            <strong>Q:</strong> Is it Cloudflare AI?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> formerly

        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Why is it called pigeon?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_post" target="_blank">Because historically
                pigeons delivered messages</a>. The name was chosen arbitrarily - it was just a random word and I later
            found a good reason for it. You know, because pigeon literally delivers AI generated messages?

        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Can it process and/or generate images?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> no, and never.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> How much does it cost to run this?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Basically nothing. Hosting is cheap and tokens are too. Roughly, under $15 a month.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Can I discuss explicit content with it?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Probably not. I didn't tell it "no", but the model itself might refuse. After all, it is
            Google.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Why does the model change so much?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> It doesn't. The last model switch was in February 2026. Here is a timeline of the models used:
            <ul>
                <li>September 2024 - April 2025: GPT-3.5</li>
                <li>April 2025 - May 2025: Gemma 2B</li>
                <li>May 2025 - July 2025: LLaMA 4 Scout</li>
                <li>July 2025 - February 2026: Gemini 2.5 Flash</li>
                <li>February 2026 - present: Grok 4 Fast</li>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> What is this error?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> All errors are logged. If you see one, tell me when it happened, and I'll
            investigate.<br>
            Upon errors, pigeon will retry your prompt 3 times. This <i>should</i> still work, but if it doesn't, send
            it my way.<br><br>Common errors include "cannot read property 0 of undefined", which basically means
            nothing; just re-send your message. If you get a long error about Google AI, it's self-explanatory from
            there.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Why is it so slow?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Because it isn't tuned for speed. Also, pigeon does not stream ongoing responses, it
            only responds once the engine is finished; with everything it generated. Streaming is a bit of an illusion
            to make it feel faster, but the times are roughly the same as GPT 5.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> How did you make this?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Queue some big-room EDM and read a lot of documentations. It uses discord.js,
            @google/genai to actually talk, and lots of if elses.<br><br>

            before inviting, instead of inviting and getting mad at it, "what is this shit?!?!1".

            pigeon is far from a flagship bot, a flashy bot, or apps like ChatGPT, Copilot or Grok. pigeon is designed
            to be a simple, no-nonsense AI Discord chatbot. It cannot handle attachments, generating images, executing
            code. It can only chat and lightly search the web - no deep searching, reasoning, anything fancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            pigeon is simple and private by design. A companion, a helper, something to laugh at. Whatever you want to
            call it. It is not a coding assistant, a search engine, a therapist, a significant other, or an AI trying to
            take your job. All it does is yap.
        </p>

            Chat context is stored in memory and lost when restarted, and the bot only collects your guild and channel
            ID, as well as how many messages you send, obviously including your own ID. All of this can be easily
            deleted and is not considered private information. pigeon can also work in DMs, for extra privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, I cannot see your messages. And I don't think I want to.

            pigeon will probably shine in smaller servers, niche communities, meme-heavy servers, or your own private
            server. pigeon may work in medium-sized servers, but it is not designed for large servers, corporate
            servers, or people who don't like simplicity and want more. To put plainly: <strong>pigeon isn't here to
                outperform anyone else</strong>.
            It's extremely basic, and that's the point.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, pigeon is not <a href="https://mee6.xyz/en/careers">owned by a large corporation</a> and <a href="https://anywhere.twitter.com/MEE6NFT/status/1479205493935591434">their own NFTs</a>.
            To you, that is either a good thing or a bad thing, but it's your domain.
